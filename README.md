Google App Engine - Workshop (GDG Ahmedabad - April 2013)
===================================

This project is meant for any Java Developer to get going with [Google App Engine](https://developers.google.com/appengine/), the popular PaaS from Google. 

This project contains the Presentation, App Engine Projects and Hands-on Exercises for App Engine Workshop, that is planned for GDG Ahmedabad Workshop on April 21, 2013. 

Contents of the respective directories:

- In the main folder, you will find the presentation : **Mindstorm-AppEngine-Training.pptx**
- `hands-on-exercises` : This contains several DOCX documents, which are explained here:
 
 - `From Scratch - Google App Engine Development Environment Setup.docx`: Follow this document first to setup your development environment for Google App Engine. At a high level, the document instructs you to install Java JDK version 6, Eclipse Juno 4.2 and Google Plugin for Eclipse, which will contain the latest App Engine Java SDK 1.7.7 (April 2013 Release). All the instructions for download are there in the document, including verifying that your setup is good.
 - `HelloWorld.docx`: Follow the instructions here to write a Hello World application using Google App Engine Java and how to deploy your application to the Google Cloud. 
 - `ExamResults-Step-*`: There are a series of documents here that you need to follow step by step and preferably in order. All of these documents are referenced from the Presentation. So go through the presentation and it will tell you at the right time, which document to refer to complete the hands-on exercise.
- `hands-on-exercises/Exam Results App`: This folder contains several projects. Each of these projects are for a specific step in the workshop and are Eclipse projects that you can directly import. They are referenced in the above DOCX documents and as you go through the DOCX, it will tell you at the right time, when you import the project into Eclipse, so that you can study the code.
